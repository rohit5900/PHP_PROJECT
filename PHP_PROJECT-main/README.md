# Sleep Tracker Application

A web application for tracking sleep patterns with user authentication.

## Automatic Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/)
   - Make sure Apache and MySQL services are running

2. **Quick Start**:
   - Copy the entire project folder to `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to `http://localhost/PHP_PROJECT-main/setup.php`
   - The setup script will automatically:
     - Create required databases
     - Create necessary tables
     - Set up foreign key relationships
   - After successful setup, click the link to go to the login page

3. **Using the Application**:
   - Register a new account
   - Log in with your credentials
   - Start tracking your sleep patterns

## Manual Setup (if needed)

If the automatic setup fails, you can manually:
1. Create databases `login_system` and `sleep_tracker`
2. Import the SQL files from:
   - `login_system/database.sql`
   - `pages/backend/update_database.sql`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check if XAMPP services are running
2. Verify database credentials in `config/db.php`
3. Check file permissions
4. Look for error messages in the browser console

To branch and clone a repository on GitHub web and on the Git CLI, follow these steps:

On GitHub Web:
Branch:

Navigate to your repository.
Click on the "main" branch dropdown.
Type the name of your new branch in the "Find or create a branch" field.
```sh
Click "Create branch: <your-branch-name> from 'main'".
```
Clone:

On your repository's main page, click the green "Code" button.
Copy the URL provided under the "HTTPS" tab.
Open your terminal and run:
sh
```sh
git clone <copied-URL>
```
On Git CLI:
Branch:

Navigate to your local repository in your terminal.
Create and switch to a new branch using:
sh
```sh 
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```
Clone:

Open your terminal and run:
sh
```sh
git clone <repository-URL>
 ```
Navigate to the cloned repository: sh
```sh 
cd <repository-name>
 ```
Replace <your-branch-name> and <repository-URL> with your desired branch name and the URL of the repository you want to clone, respectively.
  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Branch
```sh
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```
or

```sh
git switch -c <new-branch-name>
```
üîπ This creates and switches to a new branch, keeping the main code untouched.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add or Modify Files
Edit or add your files, then stage them:
```sh
git add <file-name>
```
or to add all changes:
```sh
git add .
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Commit the Changes
```sh
git commit -m "Added new feature or file"
```
This saves the changes in the new branch.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Push the New Branch (Optional, if working with GitHub)
```sh
git push origin <new-branch-name>
```
üîπ This uploads your new branch to the remote repo without affecting main.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Merge into Main (Later, if needed)
Once your changes are complete and tested, you can merge them into main:
```sh
git checkout main
git merge <new-branch-name>
```
If working with GitHub, you can open a Pull Request (PR) instead.
Navigate to the cloned repository: sh
```sh 
cd <repository-name>
 ```
Replace <your-branch-name> and <repository-URL> with your desired branch name and the URL of the repository you want to clone, respectively.
